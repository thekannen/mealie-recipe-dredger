# 🍲 Recipe Dredger (Mealie & Tandoor)

A bulk-import automation tool to populate your self-hosted recipe managers with high-quality recipes.

> **⚠️ Note regarding Tandoor:** This script was built and tested specifically for **Mealie**. Tandoor support was added via community request and is currently **untested** by the author. If you use Tandoor, please report your results in the Issues tab!

This script automates the process of finding **new** recipes. It scans a curated list of high-quality food blogs, detects new posts via sitemaps, checks if you already have them in your library, and imports them automatically.

## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-Platform:** Supports importing to **Mealie** (Primary) and **Tandoor** (Experimental).
* **Multi-Language Support:** Automatically detects and filters recipes. Supports single or multiple languages (e.g., `en` or `en,de,fr`).
* **Smart Deduplication:** Checks your existing libraries first. It will never import a URL you already have.
* **Recipe Verification:** Scans candidate pages for Schema.org JSON-LD to ensure it only imports actual recipes.
* **Deep Sitemap Scanning:** Automatically parses XML sitemaps to find the most recent posts.
* **Curated Source List:** Comes pre-loaded with over 100+ high-quality food blogs covering African, Caribbean, East Asian, Latin American, and General Western cuisines.

## 🐳 Quick Start (Docker)

The most efficient way to run the Dredger is using Docker. You do not need to clone the repository or install Python.

1.  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  recipe-dredger:
    image: ghcr.io/d0rk4ce/mealie-recipe-dredger:latest
    container_name: recipe-dredger
    environment:
      # --- Connection Settings ---
      - MEALIE_ENABLED=true
      - MEALIE_URL=[http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)X:9000
      - MEALIE_API_TOKEN=your_mealie_token
      - TANDOOR_ENABLED=false
      - TANDOOR_URL=[http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)X:8080
      - TANDOOR_API_KEY=your_tandoor_key
      
      # --- Scraper Behavior ---
      - DRY_RUN=false                  # Set to true to test without importing
      - TARGET_RECIPES_PER_SITE=50     # Stop after importing this many per site
      - SCAN_DEPTH=1000                # How many links to check before giving up on a site
      - SCRAPE_LANG=en,de              # Filter content by language
      
      # --- Sources ---
      # Optional: Override the built-in site list
      - SITES=[https://example.com](https://example.com),[https://another-blog.com](https://another-blog.com)
    restart: "no"
```
